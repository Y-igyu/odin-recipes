        <p>If you've never had Nashville Hot Chicken, we're talking about mouthwateringly, ultra-crispy, fiery fried chicken with a cayenne-infused glaze, and by 'glaze' I mean melted butter and lard. While i've never been to Nashville myself, this recipe works well for me. Serve chicken pieces on white bread and brush with extra sauce if you like. Serve with pickles.</p>
